# Data Science and Data Wrangling Projects
In here I publish the prjects and taks I've done on different datasets.

## 1. Voltage by Current
In this [project](https://github.com/berserkhmdvhb/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Voltage-by-Current.ipynb), a text containing multiple values was given. I had to extract current and voltage from this text and then visualize the current based on voltage using different plotting methods in Python.
